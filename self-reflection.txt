- In previous program using C#, room data and allocation data was using list data type, I convert it to map.
- Because with map, I could easily check duplication for room number and map offer better performance by finding key faster than using array loop through each element one by one.

- When customer check out a room, I added calculation for billing in function deallocation, based on number of day customer stayed plus extra fee

- For most hotel in real world, room numbers are always format of 3 or 4 digits only
