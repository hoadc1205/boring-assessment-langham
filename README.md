Introduction
The Hotel Room Management System (HRMS) is a Python-based console application designed to streamline the management of hotel room bookings and allocations. This application provides a simple yet effective way to handle various tasks, such as room addition, deletion, allocation, and deallocation. It aims to assist hotel staff in maintaining an organized record of available and occupied rooms, as well as managing customer check-ins and check-outs efficiently.

The application uses a set of utility functions for data input validation and predefined constants to standardize room types and statuses, enhancing the reliability and maintainability of the system. It provides an interactive experience through the command line, allowing users to perform key operations related to room management seamlessly.

Purpose
The primary purpose of this application is to:

Automate Hotel Room Management: Simplify the process of managing hotel rooms by providing a digital record-keeping system, replacing traditional manual methods.
Efficient Room Allocation: Allow hotel staff to allocate rooms to customers, update check-in and check-out dates, and manage extra charges effectively.
Maintain Room Availability: Keep track of room statuses (Available, Occupied, Unavailable) in real-time to ensure efficient room usage.
Backup Room Allocation Data: Ensure data persistence and integrity by implementing a backup feature for room allocation records, preventing data loss in case of system failure.
Provide a User-Friendly Interface: Offer an intuitive and straightforward console-based interface for hotel staff to easily navigate and perform their tasks.
This system is suitable for small to medium-sized hotels looking to automate their room management processes without needing a complex or costly software solution.
